Born in Brazil, Sebastian Rojas started photographing surfing in the 80's and since the beginning of his career he chose aquatic photography, "I've always been passionate about the feeling of swimming beneath the waves and water action" and since then he never stopped traveling and photographing for Fluir, Brazil's biggest magazine on this segment. With over 60 covers published, Rojas has travelled across the world producing pictures and issues in remote places, always having aquatic photos as his main feature.

Next year he celebrates 30 years of career while he continues to practice aquatic photography as a sport and profession always bearing in mind the evolution of the latest techniques in surfing photography.

In 2006, he started to teach aquatic photography workshops and hundreds of students have had the chance to attend and receive the teachings of Brazil's aquatic photography master.

"This new generation has been making me so proud for exercising their talent in aquatic photography and publishing high-quality material."
