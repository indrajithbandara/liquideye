Henrique Pinguim or "Penguin" is above all a love by the sea. Saw the photo birth unpretentiously, on any given day, recording the performance of friends.

But the joke worked. In fact, very right and very fast.
The distinctive look and amazing images generated in a short time it was touted as one of the greatest revelations of aquatic photography.

Since then made the cover of major publications around the globe. His images also rolled the world stamping ads, websites and magazines.

Here he shares with you that frames this is more than a job, it is a privilege.
