quote: "Through the years I have had the opportunity to try and use many brands of water-housings. I have experimented with many systems and many materials. For the past 10 years I have been using Liquid Eye water-housings and I am completely hooked. They have the best systems ever. Liquid Eye’s housings are lightweight, strong, and there are a multitude of add-on features that are available. The zoom control and the pistol grip systems are amazing, they help me to push the limits of my water photography. The service is great too, a perfect combo!"
