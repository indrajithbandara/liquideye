quote: "An opportunity to work with Liquid Eye housing has elevated the quality of my photos to a higher level. The Liquid Eye housing is just the best, really light and strong, and it gives me much more security when I go to the water. It is now easier for me to get the perfect sharpness with the right focus point and that way work more efficiently. Individual production of each housing is another advantage of Liquid Eye, with his experience, Philippe knows exactly what we need. Working with him is a big step in my career. It’s really great to be on board!"
