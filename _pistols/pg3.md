Liquid Eye has released an improved pistol system for their splash camera housings. A new two-stage trigger 100% sand safe has been incorporated that allows for both focusing and firing using one button.

The initial AF portion of the trigger stroke has been lengthened relative the shutter release portion of the trigger stroke to give you greater AF control while swimming, and this helps you avoid accidental mis-fires when your attention is on getting in position or while you are going through the spin cycle if you get caught inside.

Additionally, the pistol grip has been redesigned to be lighter and more ergonomic in your hand, with new side 3M rubber band for a better and softer grip.
