Liquid Eye has released an improved pistol system for their splash camera housings. The PG4 is aiming the fish eye and wide angle water shooting. When hyper focal method is applicable, this pistol grip with one stage position will give you more reactivity and you will earn some extra speed on motor drive.

The pistol grip PG4 is included in all our e-models (C1900, C1950, C1900F).

Additionally, the PG4 can be upgraded to turn into a PG3 along the line by getting the PG3 kit.
