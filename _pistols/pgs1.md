The proprietary PGS1 Dual Stage AF Pistol Grip allows for both focusing and firing using one button. The initial AF portion of the trigger stroke has been lengthened relative the shutter release portion of the trigger stroke to give you greater AF control. This helps you avoid accidental mis-fires while swimming.
