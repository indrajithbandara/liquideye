The housing is constructed from high-strength, extremely durable polyurethane. The controls are ergonomically designed and built using marine grade stainless steel, and tough composites. The housing controls include a front shutter button and zoom control.

A Plexiglas back plate is secured using 5 recessed and captured hex drive stainless steel bolts. Our 5-screw closure system insures a tight, even seal, while eliminating the problems of screw loss, corrosion, accidental opening and dangerous exposed metal edges.

The C2100 package includes the L-LP-65 port and features an interchangeable port system for the Nikon lens series. This water housing uses the LP Series Lens Port system.

The proprietary PG5 AF Dual Stage Pistol Grip allows for both focusing and firing using one button. The initial AF portion of the trigger stroke has been lengthened relative the shutter release portion of the trigger stroke to give you greater AF control. This helps you avoid accidental mis-fires while swimming.
