The housing is constructed from high-strength, extremely durable polyurethane. The controls are ergonomically designed and built using marine grade stainless steel, and tough composites. The housing controls include a front shutter button and zoom control.

A Plexiglas back plate is secured using 5 recessed and captured hex drive stainless steel bolts. Our 4-screw closure system insures a tight, even seal, while eliminating the problems of screw loss, corrosion, accidental opening and dangerous exposed metal edges.

The C6000 package includes the S-LP-55 port and features an interchangeable port system for the Canon lens series. This water housing uses the S-LP Series Lens Port system.
