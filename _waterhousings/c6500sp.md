The housing is constructed from high-strength, extremely durable polyurethane. The controls are ergonomically designed and built using marine grade stainless steel, and tough composites. The housing controls include a front shutter button and zoom control.

A Plexiglas back plate is secured using 4 recessed and captured hex drive stainless steel bolts. Our 4-screw closure system insures a tight, even seal, while eliminating the problems of screw loss, corrosion, accidental opening and dangerous exposed metal edges.

The C6500 package includes the S-LP-55 port and features an interchangeable port system for the Sony lens series.  The S-LP-55 may be exchanged for any of our other Sony ports of equal value or we apply USD 150 credit towards the port of your choice. This water housing uses the S-LP Series Lens Port system.

A detachable 2-stage pistol grip PGS1 is included.

Flash Control is optional. We also have Spare Parts Kits available, please inquire.
