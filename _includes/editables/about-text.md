Established in 1995, Liquid Eye is a European based company who build splash water housing for Canon®, Nikon® still cameras and Sony® video cameras. Specially dedicated to water sports such as: surf, windsurf, kite board, wakeboard, wave ski, sail and motor boats and so on. Those housings are completely handcrafted and build in the finest composite material.

Created at the beginning by a professional photographer who wished to have gear totally adapted to his needs and his necessities.

Photographer Philippe Chevodian, become the special designer of Liquid Eye. His trips around the world in search of new waves, lead him to always try to reduce his equipment and it is natural that the concept of our housings is influenced by those choices.

Thus, our production is essentially centered on weight and volume earnings, primeval factors in action photography.

Our products are conceived and designed by professional photographers. That is the key of our success.
