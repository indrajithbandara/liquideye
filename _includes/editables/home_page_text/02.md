Our Standard water housings are for Canon, Nikon and Sony photographers that don’t use camera back controls, but would like the option to add those controls later. Standard housings are otherwise identical to our Advanced water housings in every way. Whether it’s our Model C2100 or our Model C2050 the Standard option is available for those without the need or budget for Advanced controls.
