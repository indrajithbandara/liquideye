For the Canon EOS line of DSLR’s, Liquid Eye offers a broad range of water-housings to handle just about every application and to suit any budget.

If you shoot with a Canon EOS 400D, 450D, 500D, 550D or the 600D, then the C1900 is the right model for you. A lightweight ultra-strong, easy to use water-housing that is easy on your pocketbook. This versatile model will also house the prosumer range Canon DSLR’s such as the 40D, 50D, 60D, 7D, 5D and 5D MarkII.

For broader needs and less constrained budgets, we offer pro-models C1793 or C1793S which will also house the prosumer range of Canon DSLR’s.

And if you shoot with the Canon 1D series the C1794 will be your choice. As you can see, Liquid Eye has pretty much the entire line of the Canon DSLR’s covered for you.
