For the Canon EOS line of DSLR’s, Liquid Eye offers a broad range of water-housings to handle just about every application and to suit any budget.

If you shoot with one of Canon’s consumer model DSLR’s such as the EOS 400D, 450D, 500D, 550D or the 600D, and your budget is a bit limited, then our e-model C1900 is the right model for you. The C1900 is a lightweight ultra-strong, easy to use water-housing that is easy on your pocketbook. This versatile model will also house the prosumer range Canon DSLR’s such as the 40D, 50D, 60D, 7D, 5D and 5D MarkII.

On the other hand if your needs are more involved and your budget less constrained, then you may choose to go with our pro-model C1793 or C1793S which will also houses the prosumer range of Canon DSLR’s.

And if you shoot with the Canon 1D series DSLR’s the C1794 will also house these flagship models as well. As you can see, Liquid Eye has pretty much the entire line of the Canon DSLR’s covered for you.
