12 years ago, my first housing was a Liquid Eye. Since then, I've worked with all his competitors, to finally come back to reason and use those yellow housings. Theyâ€™re super light but strong as a rock, really comfortable to work with and reliable. The service that the company offers is the best in the biz, fast and professional. For whatever reasons, you need to ship your housing back to the factory, they will send it back in no time and for professional photographers, time is money.
