When I was looking for my first housing I have been attracted by a name : Philippe Chevodian. I am about 37 years old and I am in the surf thing since my young age. This name ring some bell to me, it was one of the photographer who gave me the will to become a photographer and it was now the designer for Liquid Eye. Nothing more attractive could be possible. So it was without any hesitation I decided to order my first housing with Liquid Eye. It was easy to speak with Philippe, he gave me very sharp and useful explanations about water-photography, he was fast and serious. All those made me even more comfortable for ordering an housing with Liquid Eye.
The water-housing he made for me is extremely sturdy and reliable even in the worst situation in a thick South West France beach break situation. It was all good!
