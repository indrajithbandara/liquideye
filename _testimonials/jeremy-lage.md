I bought my first housing in July 2009, an e-model C1900 for my Canon EOS 40D. Before buying my housing I had many questions and Liquid Eye¹s team of pros answered every one of my questions.
The quality of my housing, the pistol grip and the ports is excellent and I¹m confident that I will sign up for a second housing C1793S for my 7D.
All I can say is that these guys are really professional.
