I came across Liquid Eye water-housings while looking for a European based producer of water-housings and also because of the fast delivery.
I use the D300 housing C1891 mainly with a port for the 10.5 mm lens, and sometimes a port for the 17-55 mm The housing enables me to use all the controls on the camera body, which makes it perfect for all sorts of photography, not only action shots.
