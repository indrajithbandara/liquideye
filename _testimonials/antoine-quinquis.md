While water-shooting, what I want is to feel free to change my positioning relative to the ambient light and the action; so it is important that my gear be lightweight and easy to handle. That's why I chose Liquid Eye, my water-housing truly make it easier for me to adjust my position so that I can achieve the shots that I dream about at night.
