Our Liquid Eye Dome Port S-LD-4916 is for use with the Samyang 8mm F2.8 Fisheye Version 2
and the Sony SEL16mm f2.8 with a Sony Fisheye Converter. This 160mm (6") dome is ideal for surface photography and for use in all water conditions. Its larger diameter makes above-below surface split images easier to achieve in calm water conditions.
