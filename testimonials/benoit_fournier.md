I first used Liquid Eye's water-housing to shoot surf and I quickly transitioned to shooting more artistic shots. The housing has enabled me to get way more creative with unusual angles. Thanks to the user friendliness of the design and the quality of the craftsmanship. Itâ€™s also the safest housing out there.
