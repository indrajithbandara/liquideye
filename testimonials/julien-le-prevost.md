Liquid Eye was my first housing for several reasons-First, because it is very affordable. I own an e-model C1900 which made it possible for me to start water-photography on a very limited budget.
Second, now that I am advancing, I find that because of its modular design, the housing is not limiting me because it can be enhanced with extra accessories such as new front plates for others lenses. Once my skill level rises, I will be looking to go for the even more advanced pro-model line.
A very easy and friendly relationship with Philippe, Liquid Eye's designer, has made me even more convinced that I made the right choice by going with Liquid Eye. These water-housings offer water-shots photography at its best.
