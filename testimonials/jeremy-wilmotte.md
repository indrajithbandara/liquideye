I am a photographer from Sydney Australia and have now been using Liquid Eye water housings for a year.
The housings are super light and have a good firm pistol grip while swimming around.
The zoom control system is great and much more precise then previous housings i have used.
Any questions I had in regards to the housing was always answered within 48 hours and Philippe was very helpful when problems needed to be resolved with the housing.
